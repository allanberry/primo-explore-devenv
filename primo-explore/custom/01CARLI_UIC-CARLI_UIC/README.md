# Read Me

This package contains customizations for the UIC Library Primo VE instance.


## Uploading

When uploading from a Macintosh, you may need to remove `.DS_Store` files from zip folders, or it will not work.  Use this command:

```bash
zip -r 01CARLI_UIC-CARLI_UIC.zip 01CARLI_UIC-CARLI_UIC -x "*.DS_Store"
```
